## Introduction

Cricket is a widely popular sport, and the IPL is one of the most exciting cricket tournaments globally. The IPL Score Predictor utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors influencing the final score in an IPL match. These factors include the batting team's performance, bowling team's performance, venue, pitch conditions, player statistics, and more.

The project aims to provide users with an estimation of the total score a batting team is likely to achieve during an ongoing or upcoming IPL match. The predictor is built on historical data and trained using regression techniques, enabling it to make predictions based on the current match situation.

## Features

- Predicts the score of an ongoing or upcoming IPL match.
- Considers various factors such as team performance, venue, pitch conditions, and player statistics.
- Provides an estimate of the total score for the batting team.
- Can be used for both live matches and upcoming matches.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the predictor.

## Installation

To use the IPL Score Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/sanjay-mech/IPL-Score-predictor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd ipl-score-predictor
```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this step:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the project and its dependencies, you can use the IPL Score Predictor as follows:

1. Import the necessary classes and functions:

```python
from predictor import IPLScorePredictor
```

2. Create an instance of the predictor:

```python
predictor = IPLScorePredictor()
```

3. Provide the necessary input data:

```python
team1 = "Chennai Super Kings"
team2 = "Mumbai Indians"
venue = "Wankhede Stadium"
innings = 1
overs = 10
runs = 80
wickets = 2
```

4. Make the score prediction:

```python
predicted_score = predictor.predict_score(team1, team2, venue, innings, overs, runs, wickets)
print("Predicted Score:", predicted_score)
```

## Model Training

If you want to retrain the model on updated data or customize the training process, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset: Collect and preprocess the IPL match data, ensuring it contains the necessary features and target variable (scores).

2. Create a new Jupyter notebook or Python script for training:

```python
from predictor import IPLScorePredictor

predictor = IPLScorePredictor()
predictor.train_model(dataset_path)  # Replace dataset_path with the path to your dataset
```

3. Customize the training process as per your requirements, such as hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering.

4. Save the trained model:

```python
predictor.save_model(model_path)  # Replace model_path with the
