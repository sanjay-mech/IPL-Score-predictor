## Introduction

Cricket is a widely popular sport, and the IPL is one of the most exciting cricket tournaments globally. The IPL Score Prediction Machine Learning Project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors influencing the final score in an IPL match. These factors include the batting team's performance, bowling team's performance, venue, pitch conditions, player statistics, and more.

The project aims to provide users with an estimation of the total score a batting team is likely to achieve during an ongoing or upcoming IPL match. The predictor is built on historical data and trained using regression techniques, enabling it to make predictions based on the current match situation. The project has been deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications, allowing users to access the predictor through a web interface.

## Features

- Predicts the score of an ongoing or upcoming IPL match.
- Considers various factors such as team performance, venue, pitch conditions, and player statistics.
- Provides an estimate of the total score for the batting team.
- Deployed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly web interface.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the predictor.

## Installation

To use the IPL Score Prediction Machine Learning Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-score-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd ipl-score-prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this step:

```shell
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the project and its dependencies, you can use the IPL Score Prediction Machine Learning Project as follows:

1. Start the Streamlit application:

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`. The IPL Score Prediction web interface will be displayed.

3. Provide the necessary input data in the web form, such as team names, venue, innings, overs, runs, and wickets.

4. Click the "Predict" button to obtain the predicted score.
